# Projet-Formule-Cayley
All the code I wrote and used during the progress of the projet about Cayley Formula

TrouverArbre.py is the python implementation of the finds all trees algorithm. It only works up to 6 vertices because the amount of trees in the list exceeds what my memory can manage.

len.py is the python implementation of the finds all types algorithm. It works for any list of trees.
